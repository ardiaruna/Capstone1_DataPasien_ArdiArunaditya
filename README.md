# Health Assessment System Based on BMI
This program is designed to evaluate and monitor an individual's health by calculating and interpreting their Body Mass Index (BMI). The system typically collects key data such as height, weight, age, and gender, then computes BMI to categorize the individual's health status into categories such as underweight, normal weight, pre-obese, or obese.
